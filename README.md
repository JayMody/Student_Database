# Student Database Using Java GUI

A database that can store student objects that have unique IDs (keys).

Each student can also have a first name, last name, and number.

**Features include:**

- add student

- remove student

- search students by id, first name, last name, number (optimized)

- edit student

- sorts students by ID

The jar file version still needs to be updated. Currently, the program run from the jar does not save and of the data.
